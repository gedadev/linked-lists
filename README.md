# linked-lists

A linked list is a linear collection of data elements called nodes that “point” to the next node by means of a pointer.

Methods
1. append(value) adds a new node containing value to the end of the list
2. prepend(value) adds a new node containing value to the start of the list
3. at(index) returns the node at the given index
4. pop removes the last element from the list
5. contains(value) returns true if the passed in value is in the list and otherwise returns false.
6. find(value) returns the index of the node containing value, or null if not found.
7. toString represents your LinkedList objects as strings, so you can print them out and preview them in the console. The format should be: ( value ) -> ( value ) -> ( value ) -> null
8. insertAt(value, index) that inserts a new node with the provided value at the given index.
9. removeAt(index) that removes the node at the given index.
